			<h2>About Us</h2>
			<div class="about-us">
				<p>First of all Sheeran Sounds was once a dream i had as a young boy. I started out in the basement of
					my family home with a pen,
					paper and a desk. I started writing songs and eventually i had about 30 songs wrote and i went to
					visit a music producer and he was able to successfully
					locate artists willing to sing my music. After that i was earning about €10.00 per album sold i had
					enough money to buy a small office.<br></p>
			</div>
			<div class="about-us">
				<p>After successfully opening my office i was requested by the producer to write more songs. So i did i
					sat long days and even
					worked throughout the night and i eventually had written 200 songs. At this stage i had requested i
					make €200.00 per album sold.
					After this i had enough money saved to start recruiting and expanding the business. <br></p>
			</div>
			<div class="about-us">
				<p>Eventually after eight years of hard work and motivation i built the company Sheeran Sounds and also
					built a great reputation
					to go along with it after working with artists like Michael Jackson, Garth Brooks, Celine Dion etc.
					I have had a great journey the past
					few years and i have high hopes for new things coming to the company in the near future.
