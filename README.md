# Sheeran Sounds

 This project is based on a production company that writes songs for singers,
 and produces them along with videos.

## Demo

 My goal for this design was to make information accessible with the click of a finger as well as trying to keep it clean but functionable.

## Features

 This website is using bootstraps font awesome, from the bootstrapCDN website.

### Features Left to Implement
 In the near future i would like to bring another page along with information and videos on our recent productions.

## Technologies Used

CSS3
Bootstrap CDN 

## Testing

 This site was tested using Google Chromes Developer tools to ensure compatibility and to ensure it responds appropriately on different devices.
